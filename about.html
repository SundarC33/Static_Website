    <p>This study purposed to determine the levels of nursing informatics competency and self-efficacy in clinical practice and influencing factors on self-efficacy among Palestinian nurses in hospitals. A descriptive-correlational design was adopted. The nurses who worked in the North West Bank of Palestine (N‚Äâ=‚Äâ331) were recruited. The data were collected using the Self-Assessment of Nursing Informatics Competencies Scale (SANICS) which consists of 30 items rated on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 1(not competent) to 5 (expert), and scored by calculating the mean as follows: novice/low (1.00‚Äì2.59), beginner/moderate (2.60‚Äì3.39), and competent/high (3.40‚Äì5.00); and the New General Self-Efficacy Scale (NGSE) that consists of eight items rated on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 1(strongly disagree) to 5(strongly agree) and scored according to the average of the scale, whereas the average of > 3 indicated high self-efficacy, and ‚â§ 3 reflected low self-efficacy. The data were collected during the period from September to November 2020. Findings showed that the total mean score for the nursing informatics competency scale was 2.9 (SD = 0.7), which indicated that the nurses had a moderate level of nursing informatics competency. The average score for the self-efficacy scale was 3.5 (SD‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.8), which reflected that nurses had high self-efficacy. Self-efficacy in clinical practice increased with age and with nursing informatics competency. Thus, it is necessary to enhance nurses‚Äô informatics competency by developing continuous educational programs about this technology for nurses and engaging nurses in such programs to enhance their competencies in this system.
